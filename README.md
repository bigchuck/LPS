# LPS - Large Program Structure

Six assembler language macros for easier development of IBM mainframe assembler programs. Quickly build a program using the macros so that development effort is not derailed by register conflict concerns, base register exhaustion, and the need for modularization.

THe macros are: LPSBEGIN, LPSBREAK, LPSXFR, LPSCALL, LPSRTNGO, and LPSRTNX.
